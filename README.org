* Install

  This project is an update to the Gtk2Hs hello world you can easly
  find on the Google.
  http://projects.haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/tutorial/glade/

  The old tutorial uses an outdated & deprecated section of the Gtk2Hs
  libraries.  This project is updated to use GtkBuilder but follows
  the code in the tutorial.
 
  You need to install glade-gtk to design the UI or to load the .ui
  file & modify the design. You also need haskell's gtk2hs group of
  dependencies installed.

  On ubuntu you can install all of these with the following:
  #+begin_src sh
    sudo apt-get install -y glade-gtk2 libghc-glade-dev libghc-gtk-dev
  #+end_src

* Build

  Normal build with cabal
